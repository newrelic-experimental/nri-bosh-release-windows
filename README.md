# NRI BOSH Release - Windows

> A bosh release for deploying the New Relic Infrastructure agent to CLoud Foundry

This is a self contained bosh release for installing the New Relic Infrastructure agent on Cloud Foundry Windows cells. It includes New Relic Infrastructure agent [.msi] executable as a blob and has an install script that installs the package on Windows cells. It is a standard BOSH install package for Windows 2019.

The release is meant to be installed as an addon. In order to facilitate that, a sample runtime.yml file is included with properties required for the installation procedure.


## Installation

### Upload the release

To use, upload the release:
```bash
bosh upload-release ~/Downloads/nr-bosh-release-windows-1.20.7.tgz
```

### Update runtime config

In the sample runtime.yml file in the base directory of the repo, set the `license_key` parameter to the target New Relic account's license key to which you'd like infrastructure agents to report. 

If there are other values that you wish to modify (e.g. agent properties, custom attributes) you could make those changes here.

<strong>Note:</strong> runtime.yml contains settings for both xenial and windows cells. The xenial settings were added for convenience. You could remove all xenial-related settings if you'd prefer to do so.

...and then, use the following bosh command to update the runtime config:
```bash
bosh update-runtime-config runtime.yml
```

### Deploy to Cloud Foundry

Finally, use <strong>`"bosh deploy"`</strong> command to redeploy the release.
<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> bosh deploy command arguments vary. Please refer to BOSH documentation for [bosh deploy](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2/#deploy) command options for your CF foundation.

- Refer to New Relic documentation for [Infrastructure UI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities/)
